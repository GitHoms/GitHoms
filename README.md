## Hey, are there bugs?ðŸª²
My introduction to the IT field began with studying Python when I completed the course "Generation | Python for Beginners." During my studies, I became interested in testing and decided to develop my skills in this area.

I am currently an entry-level software tester with basic skills in Jira and Azure DevOps for task management, as well as in Postman for API testing. I have worked with Charles and have foundational knowledge of REST and SOAP, as well as in describing web services using WSDL and XML data structures.

Additionally, I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as skills in using DevTools in the context of testing. I completed the course "Software Testing from Scratch" by Artsiom Rusau and have also delved into SQL, web application testing, and much more.

 I would like to share some web and mobile testing portfolio items that I gained during my studies.
